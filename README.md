Dine Align is a website made using React, Express, MongoDB, and Axios that allows users to create diet calendars and share  them with each other. It has a search feature, a calendar editor, a profile feature, and a daily diet tracker. I wrote much of the frontend React and the API calls with Axios. I also deployed the frontend and backend to AWS ECS Fargate.
